# Waste Classification using CNN


## 📌 Project Overview
Waste Classification using CNN is a deep learning project that classifies waste into multiple categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The objective is to support automated waste segregation for a cleaner and greener environment.


This project demonstrates how AI can improve sustainable waste management through image-based waste classification.
