# 🌍 Week 1 Project - Sustainability Theme (AI/ML Internship)

## 🧩 Project Title
*Waste Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)*

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Waste management is one of the major challenges in achieving environmental sustainability. A significant amount of waste is not properly segregated into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories, leading to pollution and increased landfill use.

This project aims to develop an *AI-based image classification system* using *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)* to automatically classify waste into different categories. This can help in promoting proper waste disposal and recycling practices.

---

## 🌱 Relevance to Sustainability
Effective waste segregation helps in:
- Reducing pollution and landfill waste.  
- Promoting recycling and reuse of materials.  
- Supporting cleaner and greener environments.  

By automating the waste classification process using AI, we contribute to *Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)* such as:
- *SDG 11:* Sustainable Cities and Communities  
- *SDG 12:* Responsible Consumption and Production  
- *SDG 13:* Climate Action

## 🧠 Concept Used: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
CNN is a *Deep Learning* concept used to process and classify image data.  
In this project, CNN will be trained on images of waste items (plastic, paper, organic, metal, etc.) to automatically detect and classify them into:
- Biodegradable waste  
- Non-biodegradable waste  

---

## 🧮 How the System Will Work (Overview)
1. *Dataset Preparation:* Collect images of different types of waste.  
2. *Model Training:* Use CNN architecture (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or a custom model) to train the system.  
3. *Model Testing:* Evaluate accuracy and performance on test data.  
4. *Deployment (Future):* Develop a simple app or interface where users can upload waste images and get instant classification.

## 🔬 Tools and Technologies
- *Programming Language:* Python  
- *Libraries:* TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib  
- *Concepts:* CNN, Deep Learning, Image Classification  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integrate the model into a *mobile or web app* for real-time waste detection.  
- Add more waste categories for detailed classification.  
- Deploy the model to assist municipalities and recycling plants.
